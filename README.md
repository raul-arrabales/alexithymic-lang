### Data folder
The original dataset obtained from the Prolexitim project as well as newly generated datasets with additional processing and features are included here.
The main information provided by the original dataset consists of rows representing: 
- Anonymous code of participant. 
- Degree of alexithymia of that participant (measured using the TAS-20 instrument). 
- Identification of a visual stimulus (an ambiguous picture taken from the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) card set). 
- The original Spanish text corresponding to the narrative reported by the participant when presented with the visual stimulus.
The specific description of the variables represented in the CSV files can be found in data folder's readme.
Note that multiple features have been obtained from the original documents (original raw text field) and included as additional columns in tabular dataset files.
